# Data Exploration using SQL
## Introduction
In this project, I used a Covid-19 dataset and explored the data using SQL to analyze and gain insights into the data. This was achieved 
with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The data used ranges from January 03, 2020, to July 19, 2023.

## Objective
1. To find the percentage of people who died from Covid-19.
2. To find the percentage of people who died from Covid-19 across different countries.
3. To determine the percentage of people who contracted Covid-19 across different countries.
4. To show countries with the highest number of deaths.
5. To find the total cases and death count recorded across continents.
6. To show how the death count has trended over time.
7. To show Mortality and Case Fatality Rates trend by Year and Month.
8. To show the dates of the first recorded cases and the number of cases recorded.
9. To determine how many people have been vaccinated out of the total population.
10. To find the number of people vaccinated across different continents out of the total population.
11. To show many cases and deaths Nigeria has had so far? Show the Mortality, Case fatality rate,
		and vaccinations administered.

## Data Sourcing
The dataset used for this project was downloaded from a popular website known as _Our World in Data_. To access this dataset, follow this 
[link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The current dataset may differ from that which was used for the project as it is 
updated daily.
